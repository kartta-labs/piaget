This repository contains the source code for a tool, called Piaget, to geotag historical buildings.

Image a set of photos and identified building facades in those photos exists and only some of the
facades are geotagged. Piaget is probabilistic inference tool to infer the location of other
facades based on the geotagged facades and spatial relationship between them. Spatial relationships
are defined as sameness and spatial distance.
